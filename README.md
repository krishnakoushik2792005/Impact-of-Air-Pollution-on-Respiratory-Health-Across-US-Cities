# 🏥 Impact of Air Pollution on Respiratory Health Across U.S. Counties

This is a **collaborative project** aimed at exploring the relationship between air pollution levels and respiratory health outcomes across various U.S. counties. The project involved data collection, cleaning, merging, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using multiple publicly available datasets.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

We used datasets from various U.S. government sources (like the EPA and CDC) covering:
- Air pollution metrics (e.g., PM2.5)
- Public health data (e.g., respiratory condition reports)
- Population and geographic details

All datasets have been **cleaned, merged, and published on Kaggle** for open access and reuse:

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Merging

The dataset was processed using the script [`test-eda.py`](https://github.com/amarrr33/Impact-of-Air-Pollution-on-Respiratory-Health-Across-US-Counties/blob/main/test-eda.py), which:
- Loads raw pollution, health, and population datasets
- Cleans missing and inconsistent values
- Merges datasets using county-level identifiers
- Outputs a cleaned CSV ready for analysis

## 🔍 Key Tools & Libraries

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (for EDA & plotting)
- Public datasets from EPA, CDC, Census Bureau

## 🤝 Team Collaboration

This project was completed collaboratively. While the code is uploaded under this account, the entire process—from data collection to analysis—was done together on a shared environment. The repository showcases our joint effort and learnings from the project.

## 💡 Purpose

The goal of this project is to contribute to open data science efforts in environmental health and to practice real-world data handling, merging, and visualization skills as students exploring the intersection of public health and environmental data.
